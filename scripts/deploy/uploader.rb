# uploader.rb
#
# Publishes release artifacts into the files/ directory that the file_server
# service behind VVTERM_UPLOAD_BASE serves from.
#
# That service runs on this machine, so a release is published by writing the
# artifact straight into the directory it serves, rather than POSTing it out to
# Cloudflare and back in again. Besides being pointless work for a ~23 MB .ipa,
# the round trip is not reliable: request bodies past roughly 12 MB stall in the
# Cloudflare tunnel and the edge answers 524 before the origin ever sees them,
# which failed the .ipa step of every release attempt on 2026-09-09.
#
# Every publish is *pinned*: the artifact lands at exactly the name given and
# overwrites whatever was there. That is what gives the install page and the OTA
# manifest URLs that never move, so one Home Screen bookmark keeps installing the
# newest release forever.
